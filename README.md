# Machine Learning Project Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This repostiory explores various machine learning techniques and models applied in my Machine Learning course. 
In this course, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both regression and classification techniques, exploring a variety of models for predictive analysis. 
I've applied different approaches, including regression methods and decision trees, to enhance my understanding of machine learning fundamentals. 
I am excited to add more to this repository as I continue to broaden my machine learning knowledge!

## About Me
Katie Corcoran

I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in data analytics at Utah State University with a previous background in software development and statistics.
With experience in data visualization, machine learning, and analytics, I love using data to uncover insights that inform decision-making. I have worked on projects involving regression, 
classification, with a growing interest in causal analysis and deep learning. My approach to data analysis is rooted in storytelling, aiming to create analyses that are both informative and engaging.
