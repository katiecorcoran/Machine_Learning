# Machine Learning Project Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This repostiory explores various machine learning techniques and models applied in my Machine Learning course. 
In this course, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in both regression and classification techniques, exploring a variety of models for predictive analysis. 
I've applied different approaches, including regression methods and decision trees, to enhance my understanding of machine learning fundamentals. 
I am excited to add more to this repository as I continue to broaden my machine learning knowledge!
